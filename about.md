## Professional Background

Jerome was acquired from a national pet store chain in 2024 for approximately $14.99. Within days of installation in his 5-gallon heated aquarium, our proprietary webcam-based behavioral analytics system detected statistically significant correlations between his swim patterns and next-day equity returns.

Since then, Jerome has served as the sole signal generator for Quant Fish Capital Management's flagship strategy. His approach is entirely systematic — he has no awareness of financial markets, macroeconomic conditions, or the existence of money. We consider this a feature, not a bug.

## Investment Philosophy

Jerome does not have an investment philosophy. He is a fish. However, the Jerome AI Trading System v4.2 has identified the following behavioral patterns that correlate with market movements:

- **Rapid clockwise swimming** — Historically bullish. Interpreted as aggressive risk-on sentiment.
- **Hovering near the surface** — Typically precedes volatility. The system classifies this as a "uncertainty state."
- **Flaring gills at his reflection** — Strong conviction signal. The AI interprets this as Jerome identifying a mispriced asset.
- **Building a bubble nest** — Extreme bullish indicator. Historically correlated with 3-5 day rallies.
- **Hiding behind the filter** — Defensive positioning. The system interprets this as a flight-to-quality signal.
- **Ignoring food pellets** — Contrarian indicator suggesting the market has priced in too much optimism.

## The Team

### Jerome AI Trading System v4.2
*Automated Behavioral Analyst*

A custom-built computer vision pipeline that processes Jerome's 24/7 webcam feed through a convolutional neural network trained on 18 months of synchronized fish behavior and market data. The system generates real-time trading signals based on swim velocity, directional bias, feeding response latency, and fin-flare frequency.

### The Intern
*Tank Maintenance & Infrastructure*

Responsible for water changes, pellet distribution, and ensuring the webcam remains focused on Jerome. Also manages the website. Has been asked to stop referring to the aquarium as "the trading floor."

## Regulatory Status

Quant Fish Capital Management is not registered with the SEC, FINRA, or any regulatory body. Jerome is not a licensed investment advisor. The firm's track record has not been audited. All performance figures are generated by an AI watching a fish through a webcam.

> "We believe our lack of credentials is offset by Jerome's natural intuition and complete immunity to cognitive bias. He literally cannot overthink a trade. He cannot think at all."
