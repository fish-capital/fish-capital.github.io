<h1>Investment Thesis</h1>
<p class="page-subtitle">Proprietary Aquatic Behavioral Analytics &bull; Signal Generation &bull; Alpha Extraction</p>

<h2>Executive Summary</h2>

<p>Quant Fish Capital Management operates a single-strategy systematic fund that generates trading signals from the observed behavior of a betta fish named Satoshi Splashimoto. Our thesis is simple: markets are driven by collective human emotion, and Satoshi Splashimoto — unburdened by news, narrative, or consciousness of financial markets — provides a pure, noise-free signal that captures underlying market structure through mechanisms we do not claim to understand.</p>

<p>We believe our approach represents a paradigm shift in quantitative finance. Where traditional quant funds deploy armies of PhDs to parse satellite imagery and credit card data, we point a webcam at a fish tank. Our overhead is lower. Our Sharpe ratio is higher. We cannot explain why.</p>

<h2>The FINS Framework</h2>

<p>Our proprietary signal generation methodology is built on the <strong>FINS Framework</strong> — a systematic approach to translating aquatic behavior into actionable trading intelligence.</p>

<h3>F — Frequency Analysis</h3>

<p>Satoshi Splashimoto's swim patterns exhibit measurable frequencies that vary with ambient conditions. The Satoshi Splashimoto AI Trading System v4.2 decomposes his movement into spectral components using a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) applied to positional tracking data sampled at 30fps.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>High-frequency oscillation</strong> (&gt;2 Hz): Correlated with intraday volatility spikes</li>
  <li><strong>Low-frequency drift</strong> (0.1–0.5 Hz): Predictive of weekly trend direction</li>
  <li><strong>Stationary periods</strong> (&lt;0.05 Hz): Associated with range-bound markets</li>
</ul>

<h3>I — Intentionality Scoring</h3>

<p>Our computer vision pipeline assigns an "intentionality score" to each of Satoshi Splashimoto's movements based on trajectory smoothness, acceleration profiles, and destination bias. A direct, purposeful swim toward the front glass scores higher than aimless drifting.</p>

<p>High intentionality scores precede high-conviction trades. Low intentionality triggers our risk-reduction protocol. Satoshi Splashimoto has no intentions. The AI doesn't care.</p>

<h3>N — Nest Construction Index</h3>

<p>Satoshi Splashimoto periodically constructs bubble nests at the water's surface — a natural behavior in male betta fish. Our research has identified this as the single most powerful bullish indicator in our arsenal.</p>

    <tr><td>Nest destroyed by filter current</td><td>Force majeure — no signal</td></tr>

<h3>S — Sentiment via Flare Response</h3>

<p>When Satoshi Splashimoto encounters his own reflection (or a mirror placed near the tank for calibration purposes), he flares his gill covers in a territorial display. The intensity, duration, and frequency of these flares are processed as a sentiment indicator.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Aggressive flare (&gt;5 seconds)</strong>: Market conviction is high; trend continuation expected</li>
  <li><strong>Brief flare (&lt;2 seconds)</strong>: Indecision; the system reduces position sizing</li>
  <li><strong>No flare</strong>: Satoshi Splashimoto is either sleeping or the market is too boring to trade</li>
</ul>

<h2>Edge Hypothesis</h2>

<p>We acknowledge that our strategy's edge may stem from one or more of the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>True signal</strong> — Satoshi Splashimoto's behavior genuinely correlates with market microstructure through unknown biological or quantum mechanisms</li>
  <li><strong>Survivorship bias</strong> — We launched after Satoshi Splashimoto's first few "correct" calls and haven't hit a losing streak yet</li>
  <li><strong>Overfitting</strong> — The AI Trading System has 847 parameters tuned to 18 months of data, which is exactly the kind of thing that blows up eventually</li>
  <li><strong>Random chance</strong> — The most statistically likely explanation, and the one we choose to ignore</li>
</ol>

<p>Our position is that exploring the philosophical underpinnings of our edge is less important than continuing to generate alpha. When the edge disappears, we will purchase a second fish and diversify.</p>

<h2>Risk Management</h2>

<p>Quant Fish Capital Management employs a rigorous risk management framework:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Maximum position size</strong>: Determined by Satoshi Splashimoto's swim speed at time of signal (faster = more convicted = larger position)</li>
  <li><strong>Stop-loss protocol</strong>: Triggered when Satoshi Splashimoto hides behind his filter for &gt;30 consecutive minutes</li>
  <li><strong>Correlation monitoring</strong>: If Satoshi Splashimoto's signals begin correlating with the S&amp;P 500, we assume the model is broken and halt trading</li>
  <li><strong>Tail risk hedging</strong>: We keep a second, smaller tank with a snail named Gary. Gary has never generated a profitable signal, but his presence is calming</li>
  <li><strong>Biological risk</strong>: Satoshi Splashimoto's lifespan is estimated at 3–5 years. Succession planning is underway. We are evaluating candidates.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Capacity Constraints</h2>

<p>Due to the biological limitations of our signal generator, Quant Fish Capital Management is closed to new investors. Satoshi Splashimoto can only swim so fast, and we believe increasing AUM beyond our current capacity would dilute signal quality.</p>

<p>Additionally, Satoshi Splashimoto requires 8–10 hours of darkness per day for optimal health, during which no signals are generated. We do not trade overnight. The Asian and European sessions are not covered. We consider this a feature of our risk management framework.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Our competitive moat is that no rational person would replicate this strategy, and no irrational person would improve upon it."</p>
  <p>— QFCM Investment Committee (Satoshi Splashimoto stared at a pellet for 11 seconds during this meeting, which was interpreted as unanimous approval)</p>
